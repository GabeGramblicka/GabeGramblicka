# Gabe Gramblicka
Hello and welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

### About Me:
I am a computer science student at DigiPen Institute of Technology in Redmond, WA, USA.
I'm interested in making games and especially ones that have an impact through storytelling and world building
For now, I'm working on my coursework and game projects both provided by DigiPen.
